# Nest.js First

This is a simple project that demonstrates how to use Nest.js, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.

This project is based on the tutorial from [NestJS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzu3QXwo1BU&list=PL_cUvD4qzbkw-phjGK2qq0nQiG6gw1cKK) by [Anson the Developer](https://www.youtube.com/@ansonthedev), a channel that teaches mostly about NestJS API development and related modules. I have followed their instructions and learned how to use Nest.js, a progressive Node.js framework. I am doing this project again which I have done prior as [nest-js-first project](https://github.com/realtirtha/nest-js-first.git)
